# JavaScript Minecraft 2D

In [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khpY8sCyyt0&list=PLp9i8-l76ZCv95xSgDESyyxWT0QWRKTXJ) you will learn how to develop a cross-platform app (for web, iOs, Android, Windows and MacOS) with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Nodejs, NPM and more.

### Requirements
 - [x] Node.js -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/
 - [x] NPM (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

If you want to get started with this series, go to [the Minecraft 2D (Cross Platform) playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khpY8sCyyt0&list=PLp9i8-l76ZCv95xSgDESyyxWT0QWRKTXJ) and follow [the first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khpY8sCyyt0).

### Getting the source code

Clone by running: `git clone https://github.com/DerkJanSpeelman/GMLTouch-Minecraft-2D.git`. Requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed. Or simply press the green "Clone or Download" button, download the ZIP file and extract it on your computer.

Open your terminal, go to the path of your project, and run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Why?

**Why JavaScript?** JavaScript is really easily compiled with Node. There also are a lot of JavaScript packages and Node packages. So we can easily develop a project. With C++ or C# you quickly need an engine (Unity for example) to do a lot of work for you. With JavaScript, we can install the packages we need, nothing more.

**Why TypeScript?** I really like TypeScript... It's easy to know what variables are used for what exactly, because they have types assigned with them.

**Why Node, NPM, Webpack...?** In [this repository](https://github.com/DerkJanSpeelman/webpackBoiler), I created a template for a new Webpack project. It has some neat features: compiling, compressing/minifying, debugging options (stylelint for example). Webpack compiles all the projects' files into a bunch of static files that can be easily imported into other compilers (for i.e. iOs, Windows, MacOS, Android).

Do you want your questions here? Ask it in a comment on my latest video: https://www.youtube.com/gmltouch. And mention you want your question in the git repo. If it's a good question, I'll defenitely add it.
